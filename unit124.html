            <p>I would like to improve on the small details. I am aware of elements that need to be tidied up to give it a sharper look.
                    Now that I have a better understanding of HTML and CSS I also like to streamline my code. I know I have repeated some unnecessarily.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I would also like to give it more order. I know this would make editing much easier.
                    
                    </p>
