    <h1>What Causes Digital Projects To Fail ?</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>An ill-defined brief could cause a project to fail, as could weak or bad planning. Lack of communication and poor time management could be other factors. Unexpected costs, lack of funds or little knowledge of financial constraints would have a big impact.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Poor testing and infrequent reviewing could lead to larger problems that are much more difficult to solve as it can be unclear how they arose. If files are not stored correctly and secured the project would be at risk. </p>
