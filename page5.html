    <h1>Choosing The Right Technology For Your Project</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>1.5 Describe how you might go about using IT systems and software - how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?

        <p>When planning any project, a board using the Kanban method will create focus and allows tasks to be broken down and delegated. There are many different options available. When choosing, the user would consider budget, team and project. Other things to consider would be, do updates need to be in real time and  does the Kanban board have the ability to share files. If the project is small some project management boards offer a free basic service. One of these is Trello. For bigger budgets and bigger teams another option is Wrike. And for real time updates and file sharing there is Monday.com. </p> 
        <br>
        <p>A separate communication tool may be beneficial for some users. Like Kanban boards these would be dependant on team size, budget, and features needed. Slack offers a versatility in its free version, different channels can be selected for different groups or project stages. Ryder is another, it is similar to slack but users must pay a monthly fee. Another tool required is backup file storage system. These are known as repository management services. Project size is a consideration when choosing one of these services. GitHub is the largest of these services. Others are Bitbucket and Gitlab. Most offer free services if the files are public and charge for private projects.
