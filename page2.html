        <h1>What Tools and Skills Will Make Your IT Project Successful</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>1.2 Describing the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful? What  tools? What skills?
            <br>
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Successfully completing digital projects requires thorough planning and a clear understanding of the brief. Good time management and strong communication with all parties is essential. An accurate knowledge of budget constraints is needed, as is the ability to problem solve and deal with unexpected 
                situations.</p>
                <br>
            <p> A Planner such as a Trello board can be used to assist planning and time management. It also helps create focus. GitHub is convenient for the back up, storage and sharing of files. Slack is a useful communication tool for everyone involved in the project.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>Every project needs regular review and testing. Having the ability to make swift and effective changes is vital.
