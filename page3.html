       <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello Board
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>The first thing I need to do before starting this IT project is to create my Trello board.
                Once this is done, I will move on to my research. I will spend some time looking at different websites focusing on layouts, styles and themes. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Answering all of the questions in the brief will provide content. Next, I will create my storyboard. I will spend a lot of time planning and anticipating problems before they arise. I will devise a timeline and factor in methodical testing and review.</p>
