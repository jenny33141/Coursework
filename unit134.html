<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
 </h2>

<br>
<br>
<p>When testing digital solutions I would look at the needs of my project and team. If I hadnâ€™t used the technologies before I would give each of them a test run with a small dummy project, piece of code, or a test file. These would all be dependant on the particular IT solution involved.
