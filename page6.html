         <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve outcomes. - How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.

            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>All technologies I have chosen are free and provide the services I need to a very high standard.
                    By using the Kanban method of “to do, doing, done,” Trello allows the developer to break large tasks down into small, manageable chunks. It is very flexible so these tasks can be easily added to or broken down further allowing for more attention to detail as the project moves along.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Git and GitHub help with version control by offering a repository where all files can be saved, tracked and updated. These updates are also saved and can be tracked. This allows the developer to easily find their way through all changes in the project. The project and its changes can also be shared with others working on it allowing them to add more files and also make their own changes to the files. Every time a file is added or updated it is also backed up online.
                    </p>
