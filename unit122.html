<h1> Where IT tools appropriate?</h1>
<br>
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.


    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>All of the IT tools selected are very useful but not all necessary for my project, as I am working alone. I have used Slack to receive my course slides and guidance material, but not to share files as I do not have a team to share with. I havenâ€™t used GitHub on this project.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Trello has enabled me to track my project at all stages. Visual Studio Code has been vital for editing and testing my code. Having the ability to see my code working in the built in terminal really helped with my understanding of HTML and CSS and so gave me more direction.
