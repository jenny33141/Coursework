        <h1>Pros and cons of IT tools! </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?


            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>For me there were no drawbacks with IT tools and systems. I could have improved efficiency had I done more research and spent more time in the planning stages. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A more in depth knowledge of HTML and CSS would have saved time as there would have been less trial and error. Working in teams would be much more effective as the coding could be split between team members.
