<h1> Reviewing I.T. tools</h1>
<br>
<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am really happy with all the IT tools used on my project. With them, I was more productive and organised. They were key for planning and design.</p>
        <br>
        <p> They assisted my learning and helped me have a greater understanding of my project as it moved along. Without them, it would have been much more difficult to create, test and build.
