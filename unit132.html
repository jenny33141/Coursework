            <br>
            <p>Having a clearer understanding of the brief would have greatly improved efficiency. One of the biggest flaws in producing my project was not reading the brief from start to finish. This slowed me down as a had to make a lot of unnecessary changes. Had I done this my plan would have covered the whole project from start to finish.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
             A storyboard would have helped with productivity as I would have been more methodical working from a visual plan. More research at the beginning would also have helped to create a clearer more detailed plan.
