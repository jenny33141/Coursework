            <p>
                    I would have made better use of Trello and used it to give my project better organisation and structure. I am aware that I left too much to manage as the project developed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Team work would always be a consideration as not only can the work be split between the team members the knowledge and skills shared add so much to it.
