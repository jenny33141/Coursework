    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face and how we can overcome them.

        <br>
        <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG2.1) are international recommendations for improving web accessibility. These should be followed and understood  by developers. There are four main areas to consider, vision, hearing, mobility and thinking and understanding. The developer needs to find ways to ensure that any user with any of these impairments can access their website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This can be done by following the four principles in the guidelines. These are, Principle 1, is the website perceivable, Principle 2, is the website operable, Principle 3, is the website understandable and Principle 4,is the website robust. These four Principles have with them detailed advice and considerations for anyone wishing to build a website.
