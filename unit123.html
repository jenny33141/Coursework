        <h1>Am I happy with my Website? </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project - are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Given the time constraints and steep learning curve, I am extremely happy with my website. It functions, it is clear and it is easy to navigate.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>There are, however, many things that I would change if I was given the same project again. I would like to give it more styling and a more contemporary feel. I feel it looks too basic and dated.
